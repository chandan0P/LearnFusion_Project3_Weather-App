# Weather App

The Weather App is a dynamic web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to provide users with real-time weather information and a 5-day forecast for any specified location. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display current weather conditions, air quality index (AQI), and detailed forecasts.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Information**: Displays the current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and visibility for the selected location.
- **5-Day Weather Forecast**: Provides a forecast for the next five days, including temperature and weather conditions for each day.
- **Air Quality Index (AQI)**: Shows the AQI with detailed pollutant levels such as PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO, NO2, NH3, and O3.
- **Sunrise and Sunset Times**: Displays the sunrise and sunset times based on the selected locationâ€™s timezone.
- **Hourly Forecast**: Includes an hourly weather forecast for the next few hours, showing temperature and weather conditions.
- **Search by City**: Users can search for weather information by entering a city name, which triggers a fetch request to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the relevant data.
