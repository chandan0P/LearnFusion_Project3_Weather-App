Weather App
Overview
The Weather App is a dynamic web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to provide users with real-time weather information and a 5-day forecast for any specified location. The app leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display current weather conditions, air quality index (AQI), and detailed forecasts. The app's design is clean and responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices.

Features
Real-time Weather Information: Displays the current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and visibility for the selected location.
5-Day Weather Forecast: Provides a forecast for the next five days, including temperature and weather conditions for each day.
Air Quality Index (AQI): Shows the AQI with detailed pollutant levels such as PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO, NO2, NH3, and O3.
Sunrise and Sunset Times: Displays the sunrise and sunset times based on the selected location’s timezone.
Hourly Forecast: Includes an hourly weather forecast for the next few hours, showing temperature and weather conditions.
Search by City: Users can search for weather information by entering a city name, which triggers a fetch request to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the relevant data.
Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structural foundation for the application, organizing the content into a user-friendly layout.
CSS: Enhances the visual appeal of the application, making it attractive and responsive. It manages the layout, colors, fonts, and overall styling, ensuring a smooth user experience.
JavaScript: The driving force behind the app’s interactivity, handling API requests, data processing, and dynamic updates to the user interface without needing to reload the page.
How It Works
User Input: The app begins with a search bar where the user can enter the name of a city.
API Requests: Upon entering a city name and clicking the search button, the app makes API requests to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data, including current conditions, a 5-day forecast, air quality data, and sunrise/sunset times.
Data Display: The fetched data is dynamically displayed within the app's interface, updating various sections such as the current weather card, hourly forecast, and AQI details.
Error Handling: If an invalid city name is entered or the API request fails, the app provides an error message alerting the user to the issue.
Usage
Search for a City: Enter the name of a city in the search bar and click the "Search" button.
View Weather Data: The app will display the current weather, air quality index, hourly forecast, and 5-day forecast for the selected city.
